### What I learned

Learned how to use HTML5 to change an image based on media queries

<picture>
    <source
        srcset="./images/image-product-desktop.jpg"
        media="(min-width: 650px)" />
    <source
        srcset="./images/image-product-mobile.jpg"
        media="(max-width: 650px)" />
    <img src="" alt="Imagen" />
</picture>


### Continued development

Still learning how to use CSS and flex correctly
